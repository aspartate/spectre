# Make Your Own Spectres
A Python script for generating custom Spectre chiral aperiodic monotiles, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17743.
These make a very fun puzzle to 3D print or laser-cut. Simply upload the output SVG to a CAD program like Tinkercad.

See `main.ipynb` for example usage. Have fun!
